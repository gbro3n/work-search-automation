## Playwright Project Setup (TypeScript)

https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

Use the set up wizard:

`Install Playwright`

If re-installing - may need to install browsers again.

## Test Generator (VS Code Extension)

https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen

Use this to start tests. They require renaming to `*.spec.ts` and usually some modification - waits, file choosers etc.

### Record and Run Tests 

Click the flask icon on the side bar. The Playwright extention will have added controls for recording new tests.

## General

### JobServe Applications

Requires the search, if updated to have a constant name. If you save it again, delete old versions of the search and update it.

### CWJobs CV Refresh

Works well. Requires CV file name to remain the same.
